I"…	<p>Ok, what I am going to say here is probably Bitcoin heresy, in that I am going to advocate more centralized clearing and management of assets wrt exchange trading.</p>

<p>I want to be able to scale trading in bitcoin and execute across multiple exchanges. Â However have the following problems</p>

<ul>
  <li>lack ofÂ trust in (most) of the bitcoin exchanges
    <ul>
      <li>security of the exchange against attackers</li>
      <li>degree of trust in the ownership re: my assets on deposit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>inability to trade across a variety of exchanges on a net / credit basis
    <ul>
      <li>require depositing cash (fiat) and/or bitcoin on each exchange</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>

<p>I want to keep my â€œworkingâ€ fiat &amp; bitcoin assets for trading with a trusted agent (a â€œPrime Brokerâ€ in the traditional trading space) who will grant me credit across a fairly wide range of exchanges. Â  To completely isolate both the trader and the prime broker from exchange risk:</p>

<ul>
  <li>exchanges shouldÂ not hold traderâ€™s bitcoin or fiat</li>
  <li>exchanges send/receive net fiat funds + cryptocurrency to/from Prime Broker based on net P&amp;L + fees</li>
  <li>reconciliation between exchange and PB done as a secure transaction between the two. Â Could probably devise a protocol based on asymmetrical trust, which is near-transactional. Â The element which is least transactional is the wiring of funds (amusingly).</li>
  <li>much of the reconciliation can be done intra-PB or between PBs</li>
</ul>

<p>Case in point, exchanges such as BTC-e trade BTC/USD at a 100-150bp discount to bitfinex. Â Why? Â  I think this due toÂ the perceived credit risk of depositing funds with BTC-e and possibly issues in moving assets to net.</p>

<p>Perhaps there is an even more interesting angle, PrimeBrokerage V2, using the bitcoin ledger, ascertaining trust, etc. Â  Â But for the moment, taking exchange risk out of the equation would open up the market further.</p>

<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>

<p>Above and beyond solving the trust issue, more centralization or a way to coordinate amongst exchanges could help with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>â€œlocateâ€: the process of finding cryptocurrency that can be borrowed for shorting</li>
  <li>potentially offer a meta-exchange, where participants can interact with a cross-exchange orderbook, data, etc.</li>
</ul>
