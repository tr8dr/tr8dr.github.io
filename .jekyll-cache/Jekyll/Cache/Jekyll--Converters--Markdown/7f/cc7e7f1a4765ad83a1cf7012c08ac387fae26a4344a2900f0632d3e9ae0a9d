I"ğ<p>Investors are often looking for uncorrelated returns so as to better diversify. Â  If one looks at world indices &amp; Â equities, there is much less diversity between assets than there was a decade ago, indeed the cross-market correlations are remarkably high.</p>

<p>On the other hand, from a trading perspective, generally want to be able to reduce the risk by hedging or spreading against related assets. Â  For example in FX, when market makingÂ the G10 currencies, one typicallyÂ offsets inventory risk with a position in another highly correlated currency or portfolio of currencies.</p>

<p>With that in mind letâ€™s look at bitcoin (BTC) vs a variety of ETFs representing FX, IR, world indices, and commodities.</p>

<h2 id="correlations">Correlations</h2>

<p>Below have computedÂ 1day, 5day, and 15day return correlations across BTC + variety of FX, IR, Commodities, and world indices. Â  To reduce the impact of outliers (return spikes), made use of my Minimum Covariance Determinant covariance implementation.</p>

<h2 id="cointegration">Cointegration</h2>

<p>The VECM model can be used to express the co-movement of related assets across time, formulated as the change in asset prices as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Î”x[t] = Î´0 + Î´1 t + Î´2 t2 + ... + Î  x[t-1] + Î¦1 Î”x[t-1] + Î¦1 Î”x[t-2] + ... + Îµ
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or alternatively can be formulated as the VAR model:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>x[t] = Î´0 + Î´1 t + Î´2 t2 + ... + Î“1 x[t-1] + Î“2 x[t-2] + Î“3 x[t-3] + ... + Îµ
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two variations of cointegration will look at are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>constant drift, no time trend, lag 1:
    <ul>
      <li>Â x[t] = Î´0 +Â Î“1 x[t-1] + Îµ</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>constant drift + time trend, lag 1:
    <ul>
      <li>x[t] = Î´0 + Î´1 t + Î“1 x[t-1]Â  + Îµ</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Finding cointegrated assets that do not drift away from each other, even â€œdeterministicallyâ€, over time is far preferable to time-based drift. Â  I was not able to find any trivially cointegrated assets in my sample set, however, there were a number of assets with strong â€œtype 2â€ cointegration.  I was not able to find any trivially cointegrated assets in my sample set,however, there were a number of assets with strong â€œtype 2â€ cointegration.  Here is one of a number that showed 95% confidence:</p>

<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>

<p>The key linkages between Bitcoin and other assets will be driven by investor trading patterns as opposed to fundamentals at this point. Â  Should Bitcoin become more of a transactional â€œcurrencyâ€ may start to see more fundamental linkages.</p>

<p>I am dusting off some code from a few yrs ago to create a rolling view on spread asset ratios. Â Need to rework this and apply as pairs / basket strategy. Â  Will post some results at a later point in/out-of-sample.</p>
